# Power-BI-Sales-Report1

📝 Overview
This repository hosts a complete Power BI Desktop file (.pbix) that contains an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard. The project demonstrates end-to-end business intelligence skills, covering data sourcing, modeling, custom measure creation using DAX, and the design of an impactful, user-friendly visualization layer for sales teams and leadership.

File: Sales Report.pbix

Description: This file contains the data model, all data sources, relationships, DAX measures, and the final dashboard reports.

✨ Key Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases expertise in the following Power BI and analytical concepts:

I. Data Modeling and DAX
Data Sourcing & Transformation: Connecting to and cleaning data (e.g., handling dates, formatting columns) using Power Query (M language).

Data Modeling: Establishing clear relationships between fact tables (sales) and dimension tables (products, dates, regions) following best practices (e.g., Star Schema).

DAX Measures: Creating complex custom measures and calculated columns using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for metrics such as:

Total Sales (e.g., SUM('Sales'[Revenue]))

II. Visualization and Interactivity
KPI Tracking: Designing clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor essential metrics like current sales, budget attainment, and profit.

Drill-Down Capabilities: Implementing features that allow users to break down sales figures by region, product category, and time period.

Report Layer Design: Utilizing appropriate visuals (e.g., Cards, Gauges, Bar Charts, Line Charts, Maps) to communicate different aspects of sales performance effectively.

Filters and Slicers: Incorporating interactive slicers for dynamic filtering by Date, Region, or Sales Manager.
